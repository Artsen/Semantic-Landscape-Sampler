# Code of Conduct

We aim to foster a welcoming, inclusive, and respectful community for everyone participating in the Semantic Landscape Sampler project.

## Our Pledge

We pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behaviour that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
- Focusing on what is best for the community and project.
- Showing empathy towards other community members.

Examples of unacceptable behaviour include:
- Harassment, insults, or derogatory comments.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behaviour and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behaviour they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be reported by contacting the maintainers at **[replace-with-contact@example.com](mailto:replace-with-contact@example.com)**. All complaints will be reviewed promptly and fairly. The maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Scope
