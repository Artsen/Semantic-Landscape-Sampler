# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We currently maintain the `main` branch. Please ensure you are testing security fixes against the latest commit before submitting a report.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please:

1. **Do not** open a public issue describing the problem.
2. Contact the maintainers privately at **[replace-with-security-contact@example.com](mailto:replace-with-security-contact@example.com)** with a detailed report.
3. Include steps to reproduce, potential impact, and any suggested fixes if you have them.
4. Allow up to 72 hours for an initial response. We will coordinate a fix and disclosure timeline with you.

If you need encrypted communication, share a public key or request one in your initial email.

## Preferred Practices

- Limit testing to systems you control.
- Avoid data exfiltration; demonstrate proof of vulnerability using minimal data.
- Provide a proof-of-concept whenever possible so we can reproduce quickly.

Thank you for helping us keep Semantic Landscape Sampler secure.
